### Main goal of this project:

>From the beginning of this project I aimed to create a realistic prison 
that is based off a rehabilitation mindset.  I feel this allows people to get back to a more easier and communial life instead of feeling like they will end right back in prison.

> I also strive to learn more about programming so this helped me learn about biography websites and how to display information.  This project really helped me learn about project management and had a pretty good schedule for completing key points.
