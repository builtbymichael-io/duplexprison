                            Some levels are more dangerous than others, but we ensure that all inmates are treated equally.

                            Level 1 is reserved for Duplex Prison’s most dangerous and violent offenders, including individuals convicted of serious crimes such as homicide, armed assault, or major gang activity. 
                            These inmates pose a significant risk to others, requiring the highest level of supervision and containment within the facility.

                            Despite their past actions, Duplex Prison believes that even the most hardened individuals can change. 
                            Therefore, while security remains a top priority, the environment is carefully structured to support rehabilitation, reflection, and behavioral reform over time.
